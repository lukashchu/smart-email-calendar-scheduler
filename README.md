# Smart Calendar Scheduler

Scheduling meetings over email is often time-consuming and repetitive. When someone asks, "When are you free to meet next week?", users typically have to switch tabs, check their calendar, and manually type out their availability. This workflow is especially inefficient for busy professionals managing multiple events. Our extension reduces this friction by automatically generating natural-language availability responses based on the userâ€™s calendar, streamlining the scheduling process.
