# Smart Calendar Scheduler

## Interface Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing setup using Jest, Sinon, and sinon-chrome. The tests cover various aspects of the extension, including component rendering, user interactions, and mocking of Chrome APIs.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

## Prompt Testing

I used OpenAI to test and refine the prompts that would be input for both GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT 4.0 for this extension.
